# Welcome to BankDash repo

The project is deployed on GitHub Pages, [here is the link](https://coderabbid.github.io/bank-dash)

This is a purely frontend project, so it does not displaying any business logic.

It was inspired by [a free UI Kit on Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1323695683687017923/bankdash-dashboard-ui-kit-admin-template-dashboard-admin-dashboard)

To run the project locally simply install the dependencies and start:

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
npm start
```

Have fun!
